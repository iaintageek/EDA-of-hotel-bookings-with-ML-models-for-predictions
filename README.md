# EDA-of-hotel-bookings-with-ML-models-for-predictions
The code has two distinct sections:
  1. The Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
      It answers the following set of questions:
      -   Do customers with children/babies tend to cancel more ?
      -   Customers booking through which distribution channel cancel the most ?
      -   Among the repeated guests, what is the likeliness of cancellation ?
      -   Country wise cancellation and menu preferences stats 
      -   Cancellation trends of both the hotel types 
  2. Building ML models to predict if a customer is likely to cancel the booking or not.
     - Includes data cleaning
     - training various models
     - Evaluation of the models 
     - Choosing the hyper parameters for the best model to further enhance the model performance
